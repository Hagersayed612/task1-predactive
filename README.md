## 📊 Predicting Sales Using Advertising Data (Linear Regression)

This project is part of a **data analysis task** I completed during my internship with **InternIntelligence**.  
The goal was to explore and analyze advertising data to **build a predictive model** that forecasts sales based on spending in TV, Radio, and Newspaper ads.

### 🧠 Problem Statement
Can we predict future **sales** based on how much a company spends on different types of advertisements?

### 🔍 Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**  
   - Checked for missing values and data types  
   - Explored relationships with correlation and pair plots

2. **Model Building**  
   - Applied **Multiple Linear Regression** using `Scikit-learn`
   - Split data into training and testing sets

3. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Metrics used: R² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
   - Visualized actual vs. predicted sales

4. **Insights**  
   - TV advertising had the strongest influence on sales  
   - Newspaper had the least impact
